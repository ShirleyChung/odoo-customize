        The stock_calendar module handles minimum stock rules (=orderpoints / reordering rules) differently by
        the possibility to take into account the purchase and delivery calendars.

        Normally, the scheduler will go through all orderpoints and will create a procurement with a quantity taking
        into account the current stock and all future stock moves.  For companies working with fresh products, this is
        a problem, because if you order the products needed over 2 weeks now and they arrive tomorrow, then
        these products won't be fresh anymore in two weeks.

        To solve this, we added a delivery calendar to the orderpoint.  The future stock moves (they represent the needs)
        taken into account will be limited to those until the second delivery according to the calendar.
        So if I am delivered every week on Tuesday and on Friday, when I order on Monday, I will be delivered on Tuesday
        with all what is needed until Friday.

        This however is not good enough as you want to create a purchase order only before the date of the delivery as the
        future needs might change.  (otherwise you could have ordered too much already)  For this, we added a
        purchase calendar and the orderpoint will only be triggered when the scheduler is run within the time specified
        by the purchase calendar.  (a last execution date will also check if it has not already been triggered within this time)

        However, sometimes we have double orders: suppose we need to order twice on Friday: a purchase order for Monday
        and a purchase order for Tuesday.  Then we need to have two orders at the same time.
        To handle this, we put a procurement group on the calendar line and for the purchase calendar line we need to do,
        we will check the corresponding delivery line.  On the procurement group, we can tell to propagate itself to the purchase
        and this way it is possible to have an order for Monday and one for Tuesday.

        With normal orderpoints, the dates put on the purchase order are based on the delays in the system for the product/company.
        This does not correspond to what is done with the calendars, so the purchase/delivery dates will be set according to the calendars also.

        The calendars we use are on weekly basis.  It is possible however to have a start date and end date for e.g. the Tuesday delivery.
        It is also possible to put exceptions for days when there is none.

Base module for the Brazilian localization

This module consists in:

 - Generic Brazilian chart of accounts
 - Brazilian taxes such as:

        - IPI
        - ICMS
        - PIS
        - COFINS
        - ISS

The field tax_discount has also been added in the account.tax.template and 
account.tax objects to allow the proper computation of some Brazilian VATs 
such as ICMS. The chart of account creation wizard has been extended to 
propagate those new data properly.

It's important to note however that this module lack many implementations to 
use Odoo properly in Brazil. Those implementations (such as the electronic 
fiscal Invoicing which is already operational) are brought by more than 15 
additional modules of the Brazilian Launchpad localization project 
https://launchpad.net/openerp.pt-br-localiz and their dependencies in the 
extra addons branch. Those modules aim at not breaking with the remarkable 
Odoo modularity, this is why they are numerous but small. One of the 
reasons for maintaining those modules apart is that Brazilian Localization 
leaders need commit rights agility to complete the localization as companies 
fund the remaining legal requirements (such as soon fiscal ledgers, 
accounting SPED, fiscal SPED and PAF ECF that are still missing as September 
2011). Those modules are also strictly licensed under AGPL V3 and today don't 
come with any additional paid permission for online use of 'private modules'.

EU Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) VAT for telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services
=============================================================================================

As of January 1rst, 2015, telecommunications, broadcasting
and electronic services sold within the European Union
have to be always taxed in the country where the customer
belongs. In order to simplify the application of this EU
directive, the Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) registration scheme
allows businesses to make a unique tax declaration.

This module makes it possible by helping with the creation
of the required EU fiscal positions and taxes in order to
automatically apply and record the required taxes.

This module installs a wizard to help setup fiscal positions
and taxes for selling electronic services inside EU.

The wizard lets you select:
 - the EU countries to which you are selling these
   services
 - your national VAT tax for services, to be mapped
   to the target country's tax
 - optionally: a template fiscal position, in order
   to copy the account mapping. Should be your
   existing B2C Intra-EU fiscal position. (defaults
   to no account mapping)
 - optionally: an account to use for collecting the
   tax amounts (defaults to the account used by your
   national VAT tax for services)

It creates the corresponding fiscal positions and taxes,
automatically applicable for EU sales with a customer
in the selected countries.
The wizard can be run again for adding more countries.

The wizard creates a separate Chart of Taxes for collecting the
VAT amounts of the MOSS declaration, so extracting the MOSS
data should be easy.
Look for a Chart of Taxes named ""EU MOSS VAT Chart"" in the
Taxes Report menu (Generic Accounting Report).

**Goals** are assigned through **challenges** to evaluate and compare members of a team with each others and through time.

For non-numerical achievements, **badges** can be granted to users. From a simple ""thank you"" to an exceptional achievement, a badge is an easy way to exprimate gratitude to a user for their good work.

Both goals and badges are flexibles and can be adapted to a large range of modules and actions. When installed, this module creates easy goals to help new users to discover Odoo and configure their user profile.

automatically spawn new documents of the chosen type, so it's a snap to create a
mailbox-to-Odoo integration. Even better: these documents directly act as mini
conversations synchronized by email. You can reply from within Odoo, and the
answers will automatically be collected when they come back, and attached to the
same *conversation* document.

For more specific needs, you may also assign custom-defined actions
(technically: Server Actions) to be triggered for each incoming mail.

rule.  When a procurement is created, it is confirmed.  When a rule is found,
it will be put in running state.  After, it will check if what needed to be done

can also go into exception, for example when it can not find a rule and it can be cancelled.

The mechanism will be extended by several modules.  The procurement rule of stock will
create a move and the procurement will be fulfilled when the move is done.
The procurement rule of sale_service will create a task.  Those of purchase or
mrp will create a purchase order or a manufacturing order.

Fiscal positions
----------------

When considering taxes to be applied, it is the province where the delivery occurs that matters.
Therefore we decided to implement the most common case in the fiscal positions: delivery is the
responsibility of the vendor and done at the customer location.

Some examples:

1) You have a customer from another province and you deliver to his location.
On the customer, set the fiscal position to his province.

2) You have a customer from another province. However this customer comes to your location
with their truck to pick up products. On the customer, do not set any fiscal position.

3) An international vendor doesn't charge you any tax. Taxes are charged at customs
by the customs broker. On the vendor, set the fiscal position to International.

4) An international vendor charge you your provincial tax. They are registered with your
position.

========================================================================

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, Réunion, Mayotte).

This localisation module creates the VAT taxes of type 'tax included' for purchases
(it is notably required when you use the module 'hr_expense'). Beware that these
'tax included' VAT taxes are not managed by the fiscal positions provided by this
module (because it is complex to manage both 'tax excluded' and 'tax included'
scenarios in fiscal positions).

This localisation module doesn't properly handle the scenario when a France-mainland
company sells services to a company based in the DOMs. We could manage it in the
fiscal positions, but it would require to differentiate between 'product' VAT taxes
and 'service' VAT taxes. We consider that it is too 'heavy' to have this by default
in l10n_fr; companies that sell services to DOM-based companies should update the
configuration of their taxes and fiscal positions manually.

VAT validation for Partner's VAT numbers.
=========================================

After installing this module, values entered in the VAT field of Partners will
be validated for all supported countries. The country is inferred from the
2-letter country code that prefixes the VAT number, e.g. ``BE0477472701``
will be validated using the Belgian rules.

There are two different levels of VAT number validation:
--------------------------------------------------------
    * By default, a simple off-line check is performed using the known validation
      rules for the country, usually a simple check digit. This is quick and 
      always available, but allows numbers that are perhaps not truly allocated,
      or not valid anymore.

    * When the ""VAT VIES Check"" option is enabled (in the configuration of the user's
      Company), VAT numbers will be instead submitted to the online EU VIES
      database, which will truly verify that the number is valid and currently
      allocated to a EU company. This is a little bit slower than the simple
      off-line check, requires an Internet connection, and may not be available
      all the time. If the service is not available or does not support the
      requested country (e.g. for non-EU countries), a simple check will be performed
      instead.

Supported countries currently include EU countries, and a few non-EU countries
such as Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Norway or Russia. For unsupported countries,
only the country code will be validated.

base,model,"ir.module.module,description",base.module_auth_ldap,"Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups
","Adds support for authentication by LDAP server.
===============================================
This module allows users to login with their LDAP username and password, and
will automatically create Odoo users for them on the fly.

**Note:** This module only work on servers who have Python's ``ldap`` module installed.

Configuration:
--------------
After installing this module, you need to configure the LDAP parameters in the
General Settings menu. Different companies may have different
LDAP servers, as long as they have unique usernames (usernames need to be unique
in Odoo, even across multiple companies).

Anonymous LDAP binding is also supported (for LDAP servers that allow it), by
simply keeping the LDAP user and password empty in the LDAP configuration.
This does not allow anonymous authentication for users, it is only for the master
LDAP account that is used to verify if a user exists before attempting to
authenticate it.

Securing the connection with STARTTLS is available for LDAP servers supporting
it, by enabling the TLS option in the LDAP configuration.

For further options configuring the LDAP settings, refer to the ldap.conf
manpage: manpage:`ldap.conf(5)`.

Security Considerations:
------------------------
Users' LDAP passwords are never stored in the Odoo database, the LDAP server
is queried whenever a user needs to be authenticated. No duplication of the
password occurs, and passwords are managed in one place only.

Odoo does not manage password changes in the LDAP, so any change of password
should be conducted by other means in the LDAP directory directly (for LDAP users).

It is also possible to have local Odoo users in the database along with
LDAP-authenticated users (the Administrator account is one obvious example).

Here is how it works:
---------------------
    * The system first attempts to authenticate users against the local Odoo
      database;
    * if this authentication fails (for example because the user has no local
      password), the system then attempts to authenticate against LDAP;

As LDAP users have blank passwords by default in the local Odoo database
(which means no access), the first step always fails and the LDAP server is
queried to do the authentication.

Enabling STARTTLS ensures that the authentication query to the LDAP server is
encrypted.

User Template:
--------------
In the LDAP configuration on the General Settings, it is possible to select a *User
Template*. If set, this user will be used as template to create the local users
whenever someone authenticates for the first time via LDAP authentication. This
allows pre-setting the default groups and menus of the first-time users.

**Warning:** if you set a password for the user template, this password will be
         assigned as local password for each new LDAP user, effectively setting
         a *master password* for these users (until manually changed). You
         usually do not want this. One easy way to setup a template user is to
         login once with a valid LDAP user, let Odoo create a blank local
         user with the same login (and a blank password), then rename this new
         user to a username that does not exist in LDAP, and setup its groups

Ce module permet de générer le fichier FEC tel que définit par `l'arrêté du 29
Juillet 2013 <http://legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2013/7/29/BUDE1315492A/jo/texte>`
portant modification des dispositions de l'article A. 47 A-1 du
livre des procédures fiscales.

Cet arrêté prévoit l'obligation pour les sociétés ayant une comptabilité
informatisée de pouvoir fournir à l'administration fiscale un fichier
regroupant l'ensemble des écritures comptables de l'exercice. Le format de ce
fichier, appelé *FEC*, est définit dans l'arrêté.

Le détail du format du FEC est spécifié dans le bulletin officiel des finances publiques `BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213 <http://bofip.impots.gouv.fr/bofip/ext/pdf/createPdfWithAnnexePermalien/BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213.pdf?doc=9028-PGP&identifiant=BOI-CF-IOR-60-40-20-20131213>` du 13 Décembre 2013. Ce module implémente le fichier
FEC au format texte et non au format XML, car le format texte sera facilement
lisible et vérifiable par le comptable en utilisant un tableur.

La structure du fichier FEC généré par ce module a été vérifiée avec le logiciel
*Test Compta Demat* version 1_00_05 disponible sur
`le site de la direction générale des finances publiques <http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgfip/outil-test-des-fichiers-des-ecritures-comptables-fec>`
en utilisant une base de donnée Odoo réelle.

Configuration
=============

Aucune configuration n'est nécessaire.

Utilisation
===========

Pour générer le *FEC*, allez dans le menu *Accounting > Reporting > French Statements > FEC* qui va démarrer l'assistant de génération du FEC.

                        Using templates can boost the quality of your
